( ; Crack the Photoshop CS6 on Your own, or using my tools. : )

Hello,
Wanna use Photoshop for free (For educational purposes)

Only works for 64-bit.

Just download our tools or try your own :)

If you haven't downloaded Photoshop CS6 yet, download it from the below official Adobe website, if you can't download it , make sure you are signed in to adobe website, if not do it or create a adobe account:-

Tools method !

DOWNLOAD OUR TOOLS FROM RELEASES TAB, EXTRACT, RUN "CRACK-IT.BAT", CLICK ON "RUN ANYWAY", Close the window, DO NOT RUN PDapp.exe !!
And Done !!!!!!!!!!!

Note:- If it displays an error, your edition of Windows is not supported, please run the "Revert (for non working users only).bat", I can't do anything with it, do it manually as shown below.


if you are worring about security,
DO IT YOUR OWN!

1) Create a empty .txt file and rename it with the extension (PDapp.exe) YOU HAVE TO UNCHECK "Don't show extentions for known file types" on "File explorer"
or) CREATE A PROGRAM (.exe) THAT DOES NOTHING VIA C CODE LANGUAGE and rename to PDapp.exe

2) Rename the PDapp.exe located in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\OOBE\PDApp\core" to "PDapp.exe.bak"

3) Copy the PDapp.exe to C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\OOBE\PDApp\core

4) Delete the PDapp.exe that is in the original directory, not the file copied to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\OOBE\PDApp\core"


THANK YOU !!!!!!!
